        avaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
         language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected 
        to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. 
          The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong 
          type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic 
          control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript
        can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements 
            on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running 
            JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to 
            communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to 
            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
